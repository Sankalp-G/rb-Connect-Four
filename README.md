## Overview and Thoughts

1. As it was my first time properly using tests and strictly following TDD it was certainly a challenge, and I definitely  put in some extra time and effort into it

2. This is also the project where i decided to correctly modularize my code and try to maintain cleanliness, its not perfect yet but its a significant improvement compared to my previous projects.

3. Overall I enjoyed working on this project and learnt a lot along the way.

4. The unicode circles seem to act weird in my console so i felt the need to add an option to change them.
